A Catalog of Montaigne's Beam Inscriptions

IN THE YEAR OF CHRIST 1571 Michael Montaigne, aged 38, on his
birthday, the day preceding the Calends of March, already long wearied
of the servitude of the law-courts, and of public offices, has
retired, with faculties still entire, to the arms of the learned
virgins, there to pass in all quiet and security, such length of days
as remain to him, of his already more than half-spent years, if so the
fates permit him to finish this abode and these sweet ancestral
retreats consecrated to his freedom and tranquility and leisure.

Michel de Montaigne had this inscribed, in Latin, above the fireplace
in a study adjoining in his circular library. These two rooms, the
library in summer and the study in winter, saw the invention of the
essay.

Soon after he inscribed the obituary of his public self above the
fireplace Montaigne probably began painting inscriptions on his
library's beams. The beams support the roof, keeping out the world and
its weather. That Montaigne felt the same way about ancient writers is
obvious, that he chose to show it by naming each of the beams is
beautiful.

As far as I know this is the first time these have been collected in
English.

There are two long beams, A and B, onto each of which four phrases are
inscribed on a decorative band.

[[./images/fireplace.jpeg]]

The rest of the inscriptions are divided between the forty-six smaller
beams.


[[./images/regular_beams.jpeg]]

At least thirteen of the beams have had more than one inscription
painted on them, one on top of the other. Where it was possible to
read both, they are marked Bottom Layer and Top Layer.

ΕΙΗ ΜΟΙ ΖΗΝ ΑΠΟ ΤΩΝ ΟΛΙΓΩΝ ΜΗΔΕΝ ΕΧΟΝΤΙ ΚΑΚΟΝ

One lives but a little, shelter yourself from evil.

(Theognis, from Joannes Stobaeus, Greek anthologist of the 5th Century AD)

** 1 - Top Layer

EXTREMA HOMINI SCIENTIA VT RES SVNT BONI CONSVLERE CÆTERA
SECVRVM. ECCL.

The ultimate wisdom of man is to consider things as good, and for the
rest to be untroubled. Ecclesiastes

Note-- these words exist in neither Ecclesiastes nor Ecclesiasticus,
but probably represent Montaigne's distillation of that book’s spirit.

** 2 - Bottom Layer

ΑΥΤΑΡΚΕΙΑ ΠΡΟΣ ΠΑΣΙΝ ΗΔΟΝΗ ΔΙΚΑΙΑ

Autonomy is the only just pleasure.

(Sotades, from Stobaeus)

** 2 - Top Layer

COGNOSCENDI STVDIVM HOMINI DEDIT DEVS EIVS TORQVENDI GRATIA. ECCL.1.

God gave to man the desire for knowledge for the sake of tormenting
him. Ecclesiastes 1

Note--This is a paraphrase of Eccl. 1.13, which in Ecclesiasticus runs:

Et proposui in animo meo quaerere et investigare sapienter de omnibus
quae fiunt sub sole. Hanc occupationem pessimam dedit Deus filiis
hominum ut occuparentur in ea.

I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all
that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God has given to
the sons of men to be afflicted with.

Montaigne uses this paraphrase in Of Presumption and the Apology for
Raymond Sebond.

** 3 - Bottom Layer

ΜΑΚΑΡΙΟΣ ΟΣ ΤΙΣ ΟΥΣΙΑΝ ΚΑΙ ΝΟΥΝ ΕΧΕΙ

Happy is he who has fortunes and reason.

** 4 - Top Layer

OMNIVM QVÆ SVB SOLE SVNT FORTVNA ET LEX PAR EST. ECCL.9.

Everything under the sun follows the same law and the same
destiny. Ecclesiastes 9.

Note--This reference to Ecclesiastes 9.3 shows up in a slightly
modified form in Apology for Raymond Sebond: 3.2:

Tout ce qui est sous le ciel, dit le sage, court une loy et fortune
pareille.

Ecclesiasticus has this as:

Hoc est pessimism inter omnia, quae sub sole fiunt, quia eadem cunctis
eveniunt.

** 5

ΟΥ ΜΑΛΛΟΝ ΟΥΤΩΣ ΕΧΕΙ Η ΕΚΕΙΝΩΣ Η ΟΥΔΕΤΕΡΟΣ

It is no more in this way than in that, or in neither.

(Aulus Gellius, via Henricius Stephanus’ 1562 annotated edition of
Sextus Empiricus)

Note--This shows up in Apology for Raymond Sebond: 3.5 referring to the Pyrrhonists as:

Leurs façons de parler sont, 'Je n'etablis rien: II n'est non plus
ainsi qu'ainsin, ou que ny l’un ny l’autre'...

Their manners of speaking are: ‘I establish nothing; it is no more
thus than thus or than neither one nor the other...

ΕΝ ΤΩ ΦΡΟΝΕΙΝ ΓΑΡ ΜΗΔΕΝ ΗΔΙΣΤΟΣ ΒΙΟΣ

ΤΟ ΜΕ ΦΡΟΝΕΙΝ ΓΑΡ ΚΑΡΤ ' ΑΝΩΔΥΝΟΝ ΚΑΚΟΝ

To not think at all is the softest life,

Because not thinking is the most painless evil.

(Sophocles, from Erasmus' collection of aphorisms, the Adagia, first
published in Paris in 1500)

** 9 - Top Layer

ΚPΙΝΕΙ ΤΙΣ ΑΥΤΟΝ ΠΘΠΟΤΑΝΘΡΩΠΟΝ ΜΕΓΑΡ

ΟΝ ΕΞΑΛΕΙΦΕΙ ΠΡΟΦΑΣΙΣ Η ΤΥΧΟΥΣ ' ΟΛΟΝ

What man will account himself great,

(Euripides--[Lost work], in Stobaeus- Of Arrogance)

** 10

[OMNIA CVM CÆLO TERRAQVE MARIQVE SVNT NIHIL AD SVMMAM SVMMAI TOTIVS]

All things, together with heaven and earth and sea, are nothing to the
sum of the universal sum.

(Lucretius--De Natura Rerum, VI.678-9)

Note--this inscription was restored according to someone's memory of
what it said, after the replacement of the original beam. This is
quoted in Apology for Raymond Sebond: 3.5.

** 11

VIDISTI HOMINEM SAPIENTEM SIBI VIDERI MAGIS ILLO SPEM HABEBIT
INSIPIENS. PROV.26.

The fool has more hope of wisdom than the man who calls himself
wise. Proverbs 26

Note--The source is Proverbs 26.12:
Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit?
there is more hope of a fool than of him.

** 12 - Bottom Layer

NEC NOVA VIVENDO PROCVDITVR VLLA VOLVPTAS

No new delight may be forged by living on.

(Lucretius--De Natura Rerum III.1081)

** 12 - Top Layer

SICVT IGNORAS QVOMODO ANIMA CONIVNGATVR CORPORI SIC NESCIS OPERA
DEI. ECCL.11 .

You who know nothing of how the soul marries the body, you therefore
know nothing of God’s works.  Ecclesiastes 11[.5]

It is possible and it is not possible.

(Sextus Empiricus--Hypotyposes)

(Plato, via Sextus Empiricus)

Note--This turns up in On Physionomy.

** 15

ΚΕPΑΜΟΣ ΑΝΘPΩΟΣ

A man of clay.

(Saint Paul, via Erasmus)

Note--in Erasmus’ Adagia this shows up as:

Κεραμεύς ανθρωπος, homo fictilis, id est mollis, imbecillis, fragilis.

Man of clay, moldable man, that is soft, stupid, fragile.

* Second Set of Short Beams

** 16 - Bottom Layer

Η ΔΕΙΣΙΔΑΙΜΟΝΙΑ ΚΑΘΑΠΕΡ ΠΑΤΡΙ ΤΩ ΤΥΦΩ ΠΕΙΘΕΤΑΙ

Impiety follows pride like a dog. [lit.: 'like a father is followed']

(Socrates, from Stobaeus)

** 16 - Top Layer

NOLITE ESSE PRVDENTES APVD VOSMETIPSOS. AD ROM.12.

Be not wise in your own conceits.

(Paul’s Epistle to the Romans, 12.)

Note--Laterally below (i.e. not overpainted) this Latin inscription a
smaller Greek one is just visible:

'Η δεισιδαιμονια καθαπερ πατρι τω τυφω πειθεται.

Superstition obeys conceit as a father.

which is attributed to Socrates in Stobaeus: Apophthegmata, s. 22.

By placing it beneath Paul, Montaigne is trying to imply a connection
between the two men. Given the number of revisions and overpaintings,
it seems clear that the inscriptions have a complex and meaningful
spatial relationship to one another.

In Apology for Raymond Sebond: 3.5:

...ce que dict ce mot grec ancient, que la superstition suyt
l’orgueil, et luy obeit comme à son pére.

This is perhaps what the ancient Greek maxim says, that superstition
follows pride and obeys it as if pride were its father.

** 17 - Bottom Layer

SVMMVM NEC METVAM DIEM NEC OPTEM

Neither fear nor desire [your] last day.

(Martial--Epigrams, X.47)

Note--quoted in Essays II.37.

Note--quoted in Apology for Raymond Sebond.

** 18 - Bottom Layer

QVO ME CVNQVE RAPIT TEMPESTAS DEFEROR HOSPES

I shelter where the storm drives me.

(Horace--Epistles I.i.14)

** 18 - Top Layer

NESCIS HOMO HOC AN ILLVD MAGIS EXPEDIAT AN ÆQVE VTRVMQVE. ECCL.11.

You are unaware if your interest is here rather than there, or if they
are alike in value. Ecclesiastes, 11.

Note--this echoes Ecclesiasticus 11.6:

Mane semina semen tuum et vespere ne cesset manus tua; quia nescis
quid magis oriatur hoc aut illuf et si utrumque simul melius erit.

In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening don’t withhold your
hand; for you don’t know which will prosper, whether this or that, or
whether they both will be equally good.

** 19

HOMO SVM HVMANI A ME NIHIL ALIENVM PVTO

I am a man and nothing human is foreign to me.

** 23

NE PLVS SAPITE QVAM OPORTET SED SAPITE AD SOBRIETATEM. AD ROM.12.

Be no wiser than is necessary, but be wise in moderation. Letter of
Paul to the Romans, 12[.3].

** 24

ΚΑΙ ΤΟ ΜΕΝ ΟΥΝ ΣΑΦΕΣ ΟΥΤΙΣ ΑΝΗΡ ΙΔΕΝ ΟΥΔΕΤΙΣ ΕΖΤΑΙ ΕΙΔΩΣ

No one has ever known the truth and no one will know it.

(Xenophanes, in Diogenes Laertius and Sextus Empiricus)

** 25

ΤΙΣ Δ ' ΟΙΔΕΝ ΕΙ ΖΗΝ ΤΟΥΘ ' Ο ΚΕΚΛΗΤΑΙ ΘΑΝΕΙΝ

ΤΟ ΖΗΝ ΔΕ ΘΝΗΣΚΕΙΝ ΕΣΤΙ

Who knows whether that which we call dying is living,

and living is dying?

(Euripides--fragment of the Phrixus, from Stobaeus- Of the Praise of
Death)

** 26 - Bottom Layer

ΚΑΛΛΙΣΤΟΝ ΤΟ ΔΙΚΑΙΟΤΑΤΟΝ ΠΑΣΤΟΝ Δ ' ΥΤΙΑΙΝΕΙΝ

Nothing is more beautiful than being just, but nothing is more
pleasant than being healthy.

** 26 - Top Layer

RES OMNES SVNT DIFFICILIORES QVAM VT EAS POSSIT HOMO CONSEQVI. ECCL.1.

All things are too difficult for man to understand
them. Ecclesiastes 1.

Note--the Vulgate of Ecclesiastes 1.8 has:

Cunctae res difficiles, non potest eas homo explicare sermone.

All things are wearisome, more than one can say.

** 27

ΕΠΕΩΝ ΔΕ ΠΟΛΥΣ ΝΟΜΟΣ ΕΝΘΑ ΚΑΙ ΕΝΘΑ

Wide is the range of man’s speech, this way and that.

(Homer--Iliad 20.249, from Diogenes Laertius)

The whole race of man has overgreedy ears.

(Lucretius--De Natura Rerum IV.598)

** 29

QVANTVM EST IN REBVS INANE

How great is the worthlessness of things.

(Persius, I.1)

** 30

PER OMNIA VANITAS. ECCL.1.

All is vanity. Ecclesiastes 1.

Note--the complete Vulgate verse of Ecclesiasticus 1.2 runs:

Vanitas vanitatum, dixit Ecclesiastes: vanitas vanitatum et omnia
vanitas.

Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is
vanity.

* Third Set of Short Beams

** 31

SERVARE MODVM FINEMQVE TENERA NATVRMQVE SEQVI

To keep within due measure and hold fast the end and follow nature.

(Lucan--Pharsalia II.381-2)

Note- this is a record of what this very short beam once said, it has
since been replaced and left uninscribed.

** 32

QVID SVPERBIS TERRA ET CINIS. ECCL.10.

Earth and ashes, wherefrom your pride? Ecclesiastes 10

Note--probably a paraphrase of Ecclesiastes 10.9:

Whoever carves out stones may be injured by them. Whoever splits wood
may be endangered thereby.

** 33

Enjoy pleasantly present things, others are beyond thee. Ecclesiastes
3[.22]

** 35

ΠΑΝΤΙ ΛΟΓΩ ΑΟΓΟΣ ΙΣΟΣ ΑΝΤΙΚΕΙΤΑΙ

To every opinion an opinion of equal weight is opposed.

(Sextus Empiricus--Hypotyposes)

Note--this pull from Sextus Empiricus is almost certainly the source
for the phrasing of Isaac Newton's famous Lex III:

Actioni contrario semper & aequalem esse reactionem: sive corporam
duorum actiones in se mutuo semper esse aequales & in partes
contrarias dirigi.

To every reaction there is always opposed an equal reaction: or, the
mutual action of two bodies on each other are always equal, and
directed to contrary parts.

** 36

NOSTRA VAGATVR IN TENEBRIS NEC CÆCA POTEST MENS CERNERE VERVM

Our mind wanders in darkness, and, blind, cannot discern the truth.

(Michel de l’Hôpital--Poem: ‘Ad Margaritam, Regis sororem’ )

Note--The only inscription by a contemporary of Montaigne’s, and a
sign of the tremendous respect Montaigne held for him.

** 37

FECIT DEVS HOMINEM SIMILEM VMBRÆ DE QVA POST SOLIS OCCASVM QVIS
IVDICABIT. ECCL.7.

God has made man like a shadow, of which who shall judge after the
setting of the sun? Ecclesiastes 7.

Note--there is nothing even remotely close to this in chapter 7,
Ecclesiastes or anywhere else in scripture. And yet in Apology for
Raymond Sebond: 3.5, Montaigne again attributes this to the Bible:

La saincte Parole declare miserables ceux d’entre nous qui
s’estiment. Bourbe et cendre, leur dit elle, qu’as tu à te glorfier?
Et ailleurs: Dier a faict l’homme semblable à l’ombre; de laquelle qui
jugera quand par l’esloignement de la lumiére elle sera esvanouye?

Holy Scripture declares miserable those who think well of themselves:
"Dust and ashes," it says to them, "what have you to glory in?" And
elsewhere: "God has made man like the shadow; who can say of it when
it will have vanished with the passing of the light?"

** 38

SOLVM CERTVM NIHIL ESSE CERTI ET HOMINE NIHIL MISERIVS AVT SVPERBIVS

The only certainty is that nothing is certain, and that nothing is
less noble or more proud than man.

(Pliny--Naturalis Historia II.5)

Note--the original text runs:

...solum ut inter ista vel certum sit nihil esse certi nec quicquam
miserius homine aut superbius.

..that among all of them this alone is certain, that there is nothing
certain, and that there is nothing more proud or more wretched than
man.

** 39

EX TOT DEI OPERIBVS NIHILO MAGIS QVIDQVAM HOMINI COGNITVM QVAM VENTI
VESTIGIVM. ECCL.11.

Of all the works of God nothing is more unknown to any man than the
track of the wind. Ecclesiastes 11.

Note--this text does not exist in Ecclesiastes. Ecclesiastes 11.4 runs:
Qui observat ventum, non seminat:
et qui considerat nubes, nunquam metet;
He who observes the wind won’t sow;
and he who regards the clouds won’t reap.
and so could conceivably be the inspiration for Montaigne’s inscription.

** 40

ΑΛΛΑΟΙΣΙΝ ΑΛΛΟΣ ΘΕΩΝ ΤΕ Κ ' ΑΝΘΡΩΠΩΝ ΜΕΛΕΙ

Each has his own tastes, Gods and men alike.

(Euripides--Hippolytus 104, from Erasmus)

** 41

ΕΦ ' Ω ΦΡΟΝΕΙΣ ΜΕΓΙΣΤΟΝ ΑΠΟΛΕΙ ΤΟΥΤΟ ΣΕ ΤΟ ΔΟΚΕΙΝ ΤΙΝ ' ΕΙΝΑΙ

That on which you so pride yourself will be your ruin, you who think
yourself to be somebody.

(Menander--fragment of the Empipragmene, from Stobaeus- Of Arrogance)

** 42

ΤΑΡΑΣΣΕΙ ΤΟΥΣ ΑΝΘΡΩΠΟΥΣ ΟΥ ΤΑ ΠΡΑΓΜΑΤΑ

ΑΛΛΑ ΤΑ ΠΕΡΙ ΤΩΝ ΠΡΑΓΜΑΤΩΝ ΔΟΓΜΑΤΑ

That which worries men are not things

but that which they think about them.

(Epictetus--Enchiridion, from Stobaeus- Of Death)

** 43

ΚΑΛΟΝ ΦΡΟΝΕΙΝ ΤΟΝ ΘΝΗΤΟΝ ΑΝΘΡΩΠΟΙΣ ΙΣΑ

It is fitting for a mortal to have thoughts appropriate to men.

(Sophocles--fragment from The Colchians, from Stobaeus- Of Arrogance)

** 44

QVID ÆTERNIS MINOREM CONSILIIS ANIMVM FATIGAS

Why with designs for the far future do you weary a mind that is
unequal to them?

(Horace--Carmina II.11)

**  45 - Bottom Layer

QVARE IGNORAS QVOMODO ANIMA CONJVGITVR CORPORI NESCIS OPERA
DEI. ECCL. 11.

As you are ignorant of the way of the spirit, so you do not know the
works of God. Ecclesiastes 11.

Note--The source is Ecclesiastes 11.5, which in the Vulgate runs:

Quomodo ignoras quae sit via spiritus, et qua ratione compingantur
ossa in ventre praegnantis, sic nescis opera Dei qui fabricator est
omnium.

As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones
do grow in the womb of her who is with child, even so thou knowest not
the works of God who maketh all.

cf. also Apology for Raymond Sebond: 3.5
